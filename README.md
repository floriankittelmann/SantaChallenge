# SantaChallenge

This project in relation to the FTP_Alg module of the Master of Science in Engineering (https://www.msengineering.ch/). The challenge is based on the santas stolen sleigh challenge on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/santas-stolen-sleigh). The aim is to find the most efficient way for santa to load his sleigh and deliver the christmas gifts over the world. The list of gifts are found in data/gifts.csv and using the jupyter-notebook in verification/santa-Visualize_and_verify.ipynb the submission can be visualized.
